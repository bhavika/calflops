## calflops

A tool to calculate FLOPs and the number of parameters for neural networks 

This library is a slightly cleaned up fork of https://github.com/MrYxJ/calculate-flops.pytorch. 
All credit for the core logic goes to the author [MrYXJ](https://github.com/MrYxJ/).

This fork aims to improve a few things: 

1. Provide cleaner examples of how to use the library
2. Provide a better installation experience so that the library can be installed in production projects 
3. Improve the documentation and formatting to adhere to PEP8 standards when possible.
